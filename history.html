        <p><b>CAGAYAN DE ORO AND ITS SURROUNDING</b> were occupied by people around 350 AD.
             Signs of ancient habitation were discovered in 1970 by field researchers of the National Museum.
              The researchers were exploring Huluga, a place eight kilometers south of the present Cagayan de Oro City.</p>
              <p>Huluga is a promontory(A promontory is "a high ridge of land or rock putting out into a body of water; a headland" -- The American Heritage Dictionary, Third Edition.) with two main sections: a set of caves and an Open Site .
                 The Open Site appears to be the village of the original people of Cagayan de Oro.</p>
                 <p>Inside the cave were skeletons, pots, potsherds, tools, possibly Indian glass beads,
                     Chinese pot fragments, and vestiges of possibly Annamese and Thai wares -- indications of overseas trading.
                      The Open Site yielded potsherds, Chinese celadon sherds, and obsidian flakes.</p>
                      <p>Researchers sent a skull fragment to Dr. Jeffrey Bada of the external site Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, where it was subjected to acid racemization, a dating technique. Bada then wrote a letter to anthropologist Dr.
                         Linda Burton of Xavier University, indicating that the sample came from 350 AD,*** the Late Neolithic Period.</p>

                         <p>
                            In 1622, two Augustinian Recollect missionaries first came to Huluga, then called Himologan. 
                            Here they met a mixed stock of Bukidnons and Visayas who lived in a settlement perched on a cliff, overlooking a river. 
                            The men had massive tattoos, like those of the Visayan pintados, and the women wore intricate jewelry, some made of gold.</p>
                         <p>The priests were Fray Juan de San Nicolas and Fray Francisco de la Madre de Dios. According to their journals, the natives were polytheistic animists, not Muslims. But they paid tributes to Sultan Kudarat through his emissaries.
