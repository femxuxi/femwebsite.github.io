         <li><h2 class="ttit">Gardens of Malasag Eco-Tourism Village</h2></li>
         <img id="picc" src="img/malasag.jpg" alt="Garden1" width="50%"><br>
         <div class="frame">
         <p>Gardens of Malasag Eco-Tourism Village sits on 6.2 hectares of
          land etched with eco-trails that connect to a 57-hectare forest reserve. The village is a proud showcase
          of Mindanao's distinct culture through a wondrous display of artifacts, theme cottages with its unique
          architectural designs - all blended to the natural environment. It gives us a glimpse of the rich customs
          and traditions of ethnic Mindanaoans, which form part of the great Filipino heritage. Akey component of
          the village is the Tribal Homes, a treasure trove of traditional and indigenous artifacts. There is also the
          Ethnic Museums, under the wing of the National Museum that offers hands-on experience on weaving,
          handicrafts, ornamentation and weaponry making. A collection of rare species of flora and fauna
          abound in the village, a must-see for environment conservationists.

          <img id="picc" src="img/statue.jpg" alt="Divine Mercy" width="50%"><br>
          <div class="frame">
          <p>While you’re in Cagayan de Oro, be sure to pay a visit to the Divine Mercy Shrine, a testament to faith and spirituality.
             The shrine’s most striking feature is the towering 50-foot-tall statue of Jesus Christ. However, this is no ordinary statue.
             The “rays” that radiate from the statue’s body actually form a staircase believed to lead the faithful upwards.
            </p></div>

             <li><h2 class="ttit">Solo River Kayaking</h2></li>
             <img id="picc" src="img/kayaking.jpg" alt="Kayak" width="50%"><br>
             <div class="frame">
             <p>For those seeking an even greater challenge, solo river kayaking in Cagayan de Oro offers an adrenaline-pumping experience.
               Paddle on your own and feel your core and arm muscles working double-time as you navigate the river’s twists and turns. Depending on the river’s state, kayaking can be a relaxing journey,
               but more often than not, it provides an exhilarating experience that rivals the excitement of both whitewater rafting and river tubing combined.
